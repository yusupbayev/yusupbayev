## 🛡️ Professional Summary
I am a dedicated security researcher focused on mastering the **"Web-to-Shell"** pipeline and **Linux System Security**. I am currently working through a structured curriculum (HTB Academy) and rebuilding my portfolio to emphasize high-quality documentation and repeatable exploitation methodologies.

* 🔭 **Current Focus:** Building a comprehensive lab environment and mastering the CPTS pathway.
* 🌱 **Learning:** Advanced Web Attacks, AppArmor/SELinux Bypassing, and Shellcode development.
* ✍️ **Philosophy:** "A vulnerability isn't fully exploited until it is clearly documented."

## 📈 Methodology
My exploitation process follows the industry standard:
1. **Reconnaissance:** Deep service scanning and directory/VHost discovery.
2. **Enumeration:** Version identification and vulnerability research.
3. **Exploitation:** Precise payload delivery and initial access.
4. **Privilege Escalation:** System misconfiguration analysis and horizontal/vertical movement.
